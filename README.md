## A Generative AI Experiment

Cosmic Keys is a simple, space-themed keyboard reaction game developed as an open-source project to explore the capabilities of generative AI, specifically with Google Gemini 2.5. The majority of the code and features were guided and generated through an interactive development process with the AI model.

## About the Game

The game challenges players to quickly press the key that is highlighted on a virtual keyboard. Players are scored based on their speed, with penalties for incorrect key presses. The game features a one-minute timer, a sci-fi aesthetic, and the ability to select between different keyboard layouts (Standard QWERTY and Nordic QWERTY).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Provides the basic structure of the game, including the virtual keyboard layout, score display, and start screen elements.
* **CSS3:** Styles the game elements, creates the sci-fi theme with gradients and glowing effects, handles the visual feedback for key presses, and manages the layout skewing for different keyboard types.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the core game logic, including key selection, timing, scoring, event handling for key presses, and managing the start screen and layout selection functionality.
* **Bootstrap 4.5:** Used as a frontend framework for basic styling and layout components (e.g., container, rows, buttons, form control for the dropdown). Custom CSS overrides are used to apply the sci-fi theme.
* **Google Fonts (Orbitron):** A futuristic font is linked to enhance the visual theme.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with standard web development files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the game structure.
* `style.css`: The CSS file for all the styling and visual presentation.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and interactivity.

## AI Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort with Google Gemini 2.5. The development process involved providing requirements and iterating on the code based on the AI's generated suggestions and implementations. This README itself was also generated with the assistance of the AI.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
