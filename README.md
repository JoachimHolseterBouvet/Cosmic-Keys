## A Generative AI Experiment

Cosmic Keys is a simple, space-themed keyboard reaction game developed as an open-source project to explore the capabilities of generative AI, specifically with Google Gemini 2.5. The majority of the code and features were guided and generated through an interactive development process with the AI model.

## About the Game

The game challenges players to quickly press the key that is highlighted on a virtual keyboard. Players are scored based on their speed, with penalties for incorrect key presses. The game features a one-minute timer, a sci-fi aesthetic, and the ability to select between different keyboard layouts (Standard QWERTY and Nordic QWERTY).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Provides the basic structure of the game, including the virtual keyboard layout, score display, and start screen elements.
* **CSS3:** Styles the game elements, creates the sci-fi theme with gradients and glowing effects, handles the visual feedback for key presses, and manages the layout skewing for different keyboard types.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the core game logic, including key selection, timing, scoring, event handling for key presses, and managing the start screen and layout selection functionality.
* **Bootstrap 4.5:** Used as a frontend framework for basic styling and layout components (e.g., container, rows, buttons, form control for the dropdown). Custom CSS overrides are used to apply the sci-fi theme.
* **Google Fonts (Orbitron):** A futuristic font is linked to enhance the visual theme.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with standard web development files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the game structure.
* `style.css`: The CSS file for all the styling and visual presentation.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and interactivity.

## Reflections on AI Collaboration with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

This project served as a valuable experiment in collaborating with generative AI for software development. The experience using Google Gemini 2.5 was exceptionally positive, demonstrating strong capabilities in programming and maintaining consistency throughout the development process.

Compared to other models, such as paid models by OpenAI (like gpt-4o-mini) and X's Grok model, Gemini 2.5 proved to be much better at coding and easier to work with for this task. Its strong reasoning abilities, fast response times, and capacity to provide lengthy, comprehensive code files in a single response significantly streamlined the development workflow â€“ an area where other models often present challenges.

Following this experiment, I have found myself incorporating Gemini into my development process more frequently and highly recommend others to try it out, especially while it is currently available for free.
